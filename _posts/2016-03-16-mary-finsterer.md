Mary Finsterer is the Chamber Music Australia Chair of Composition at the Sir Zelman Cowen School of Music, Monash University. Recognised as one of Australia's most innovative orchestral composers, Mary received the APRA AMCOS ART Music Award in 2014 for her large-scale piece AEREA while other works including her latest symphonic work LAKE ICE | Missed Tales no.1 and her large-scale work for two pianos, FALLING, have been finalists. Her percussion concerto, SILVA, was the featured work in the Ensemble Offspring programme at the Sydney Opera House in 2013 and toured nationally in 2015\. 

Mary has received many national and international composition awards in the USA, Canada and throughout Europe, including representing Australia in five ISCM World Music Day Festivals: Zurich 1991, Essen 1995, Manchester 1998, Bucharest 1999 and Zagreb 2005, receiving the distinguished Paul Lowin Orchestral Prize in 2009 and Churchill Fellowship to travel to USA in 2006\. In 1992 she received a Paris Rostrum prize and in 2001 the prestigious international award to compose for Ensemble Intercontemporain and Ircam at the George Pompidou Centre in Paris.
