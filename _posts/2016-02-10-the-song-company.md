# The Song Company

Over its 30
year history The Song Company has championed a cappella chamber music of all
genres. With a repertoire encompassing all vocal traditions, this vocal sextet
is Australia's most stylistically versatile, with a technical prowess that has
attracted composers both nationally and internationally to write for them. The
ensemble gives over 100 performances a year in their own concert seasons, which
they tour to regional and metropolitan areas, as well as in festival and
collaborative appearances both within Australia and internationally.
