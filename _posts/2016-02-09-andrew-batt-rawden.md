# Andrew Batt-Rawden 

**[Andrew Batt-Rawden - Composer][0]**

A trailblazer for creating music that embraces Technology whilst remaining accessible and beautiful for the listener, Andrew's\] musical output is mainly for chamber and vocal music, with or without electronics. His first album "Seven Stations" was released in 2013 through Hospital Hill. His teachers have included Matthew Hindson, Michael Smetanin, Nigel Butterley, Anne Boyd, Damien Ricketson, Jim Coyle, and many others. The many artists he has collaborated with over the years have also influenced his creative development. These include; conductors; Roland Peelman, Michelle Leonard, musicians; the Orkest de Ereprijs, Alicia Crossley, the Acacia Quartet, Josh Hill, Alison Morgan, The Song Company, Australia Piano Quartet, Queensland Symphony Orchestra, choreographers and dancers; Amy Mauvan, Sarah-Vyne Vassalo, Dirty Feet Dance Company. In addition to his composition work, he has also directed/curated for festivals including Vivid, Aurora Festival and Bellingen Music Festival.  His current focus is integrating data feeds to affect live electroacoustic performance, particularly with the use of heartbeat and movement data.
